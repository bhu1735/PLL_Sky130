INTRODUCTION:  
In this era of information, analog domain has become a challenging and an important part of IC design. Almost all electronic systems are susceptible to noise and mismatch. PLL is a an important element that is found in radio, telecommunications, oscillators among others.
A 2-day workshop on Phase-locked loop (PLL) IC design by VSD was conducted.

Day 1:  
PLL Theory:
